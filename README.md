# terrarium

Terrarium is a sandbox for running JavaScript code in a browser with
instrumentation. It's designed for interactive, learnable programming
environments, but architecturally is more similar to code coverage tools.

Terrarium is **not** a security sandbox and is trivially easy to exploit.
